### My Process
- Design the Desktop Viewport first, then the Mobile viewport
- Design the flex/grid system, making sure to have both Desktop and Mobile Viewport layout correct
- Add in all the other HTML content
- Add in the animation and JS script to change prices based on user choice then bind it back to HTML

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I Learned
- More Flexbox
- More Background Images
- More Animations
- Use % and vh/vw and big components and use rem units on smaller components
